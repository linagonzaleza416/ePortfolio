## Explain communication concepts and strategies
Communication is the exchange of information between a sender and a receiver. In the past, you only had to worry about how you communicated face-to-face or in writing. 
Technology has changed everything. Information must be transmitted in a way that takes all aspects into account. This is where communication strategies come into play. 
The aim of communication strategies is to exchange information efficiently and effectively.

### Types of communication strategies:

A communication strategy can be verbal, non-verbal or visual. 

Communication strategies can be classified into two categories: written and oral. Written strategies consist of avenues such as email, text and chat. Examples that 
fall into the oral category are phone calls, video chats and face-to-face conversations.

Non-verbal communication strategies consist mainly of visual signals, such as body language, facial expressions, physical distance between communicators or tone of 
voice. These signals are usually unintentional.

Visual communication strategies can be seen through posters, websites and illustrations. These strategies are used in the workplace to attract attention and provide 
documentation. Human resources are required to place certain visual elements in the workplace to comply with safety laws.

## Communicate effectively in a professional context.

For two years I worked in an insurance company in Colombia, which is known as [Axa Colpatria](https://www.axacolpatria.co/portal/), in this company I worked in the area of customer service, 
my functions were based on receiving different types of requests from customers, in reference to insurance that had previously acquired, it is noteworthy that the company had a wide variety of insurance such as life insurance, car insurance, home insurance, etc..


Each insurance contains different types of clauses and values, so it was necessary to be a comprehensive officer, which contained the necessary information of each 
type of insurance, as each client has a completely different request to the previous one, in turn the knowledge of all insurance would facilitate the understanding of 
each situation, however from my experience, I can say that the most important thing to handle situations under pressure is to have good communication. If I could 
correctly receive the client's needs and at the same time clearly transmit the solutions we could offer as a company, we would reduce the time, speed up the processes
and both the client and the company official would be satisfied with the results.

## Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies.

In this task, as highlighted in *Work effectively as part of a team*, we had the responsibility to talk about the possible problems that could arise in our project, one 
of these problems was precisely **Poor Teamwork** in which the importance of good communication in the work group is highlighted.
