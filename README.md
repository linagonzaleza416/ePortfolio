## Communicate effectively in a professional context.

For two years I worked in an insurance company in Colombia, which is known as [Axa Colpatria](https://www.axacolpatria.co/portal/), in this company I worked in the area of customer service, 
my functions were based on receiving different types of requests from customers, in reference to insurance that had previously acquired, it is noteworthy that the company had a wide variety of insurance such as life insurance, car insurance, home insurance, etc..


Each insurance contains different types of clauses and values, so it was necessary to be a comprehensive officer, which contained the necessary information of each 
type of insurance, as each client has a completely different request to the previous one, in turn the knowledge of all insurance would facilitate the understanding of 
each situation, however from my experience, I can say that the most important thing to handle situations under pressure is to have good communication. If I could 
correctly receive the client's needs and at the same time clearly transmit the solutions we could offer as a company, we would reduce the time, speed up the processes
and both the client and the company official would be satisfied with the results.

## Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies.

In this task, as highlighted in *Work effectively as part of a team*, we had the responsibility to talk about the possible problems that could arise in our project, one 
of these problems was precisely **Poor Teamwork** in which the importance of good communication in the work group is highlighted.
